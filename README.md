To compile and run this code, first clone the repository in your desired directory. Create a Python venv and activate it. Navigate to the src directory, where you should use the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install the required library. Once this is done, you can invoke the main script with the command "python parser.py". Be sure to know the absolute paths for the XML/PNG files you want to use in the annotation, as these will be asked in the parser.py script.
