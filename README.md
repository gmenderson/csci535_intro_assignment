Repository for CSCI 535 introductory assignment

To compile and run this code, first clone the repository in your desired directory. Create a Python venv and activate it. Navigate to the src directory, where you should use the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install the required library. Once this is done, you can invoke the main script with the command "python parser.py". Be sure to know the absolute paths for the XML/PNG files you want to use in the annotation, as these will be asked in the parser.py script. Newly generated annotated images can be found in the /annotated_images directory under data. 

<ins>Explaination</ins>__
I will briefly provide an explaination for the parser.py source code. Starting with the libraries used, Pillow was chosen as the image processing tool because it is simple and fast, an ideal tool for annotating simple images. Xml.etree.ElementTree was chosen to parse the xml files because it is a built in python module fore parsing XML files. Sys and os were used for behind the scenes operations such as generating file paths and exiting the script.
